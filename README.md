# Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive weather forecasting system that integrates data preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning, and AI-driven predictive models to analyze and predict temperature trends with high accuracy. The system is built using Python and various data science libraries to ensure robust performance and insightful visualizations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature standardization.
- **Time-Series Forecasting**:
  - **ARIMA**: Statistical modeling for trend prediction.
  - **Facebook Prophet**: Captures seasonality and trend shifts.
  - **LSTM**: Deep learning-based sequential pattern recognition.
- **Machine Learning with XGBoost**:
  - Efficient time-series data handling.
  - Feature importance analysis using SHAP.
- **Geographic & Clustering Insights**:
  - **Folium-based heatmaps** for global temperature visualization.
  - **K-Means clustering** to categorize climate zones.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score for performance assessment.
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Visualizes temperature trends, model comparisons, and feature analysis using Plotly.


## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecasting.git
   cd weather-forecasting
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## 📈 Results
### Model Performance:
| Model  | RMSE  | MAE  | R² Score |
|--------|------:|------:|---------:|
| XGBoost | 1.23 | 0.85 | 0.92 |
| LSTM    | 1.45 | 1.02 | 0.88 |
| ARIMA   | 1.78 | 1.25 | 0.81 |

- **XGBoost** performed best with the lowest RMSE and highest R² score.
- **LSTM** captured sequential patterns effectively but required more training time.
- **ARIMA** struggled with long-term forecasts but worked well for short-term trends.

### Visualizations:
- **Actual vs Predicted Temperatures**: Compares model performance.
- **Global Temperature Heatmap**: Displays temperature distribution across different regions.
- **Cluster Analysis**: Segments climate zones based on temperature and humidity.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies key weather parameters affecting predictions.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integration of **real-time weather API** for live predictions.
- Enhanced **ensemble modeling** combining XGBoost, LSTM, and ARIMA.
- Deployment as a **web application** for user-friendly access.
